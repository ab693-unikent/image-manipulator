ImageManipulator
=================

Code which allows importing and manipulating and re-saving of images on the client side.

Currently the code is structured as a Jade based website initialised by the Harp server. All the javascript (the most important part) is in "scripts.js". I plan to abstract this out into class files with a demo shortly.
